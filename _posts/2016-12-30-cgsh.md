Back in December 2016, when I was eager to start my journey into Computer Science, one topic interested me in particular - Combinatorial Graphs. I had the good fortune of working with Prof. Rupesh Nasre of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras throughout the duration of the project.   

## The Idea

Just before I started working on this project, I had gone through [this excellent blog post](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/) on the implementation of a very basic shell in C. This motivated Prof. Nasre and myself to work on a shell for combinatorial graph applications. Some important points we had in mind were:

1. The interface had to be clean and clear, with no ambiguity for users. 
2. For the shell to actually be useful, it had to be capable of working on existing graphs. The shell interface had to be able to read a file with information about nodes and/or edges of the graph in a particular format and perform various operations on it.
3. Finally, it had to be extensible.

## The Process

I started working on the project in C. However, we soon realized that performing memory allocation operations using the `malloc` function was neither feasible nor scalable. I moved to C++ and started using the STL for dynamic data structures. Using C++ also gave me the additional advantage of approaching the problem with an object-oriented approach. The entire shell interface, along with definitions for graph data structures and algorithms is contained in four files, with code being appropriately distributed.

The definitions for all data structures and function prototypes are contained in the `graph.h` file. The core functionality of the program is contained in the `graph` class. 

```cpp
struct listNodeStructure {
	int data;
	int edgeweight;
};

typedef struct listNodeStructure listNode;
typedef std::vector<listNode> list;
typedef	std::vector<list> adjList;

class graph {
	private:
		int vertices, edges;
		adjList adj;

	public:
		void addEdge(int, int);
		void addEdge(int, int, int);
		void addEdgeFromFile(int, int);
		void addEdgeFromFile(int, int, int);
		graph(int);
		graph(int, int);
		graph(std::string);
		int nVertices();
		int nEdges();
		int nNeighbours(int);
		list adjVertices(int);
		bool vertexCheck(int);
		bool edgeCheck(int, int);
		void print();
		void deleteEdge(int, int);
		std::vector<int> verticesList(void);
		bool weightedChecker();
		void randomWeightGenerator();
};
```

The `graph.cpp` and the `algo.cpp` files contain definitions for various functions prototyped in the header file. Initially, we didn't plan to work on edge-weighted graphs. We added this functionality only a few days later, just before working on the algorithms. Hence, some segments of the code had to be modified in a slightly unaesthetic fashion.

The `main.cpp` file handles the primary control flow of the shell. It consists of a program loop in which certain conditional statements are evaluated based on the user's choice. [Do try running the program!](https://github.com/adhityaswami/CGsh)
