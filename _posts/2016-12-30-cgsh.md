<center><b>Euler's Dilemma:</b> The Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg.</center>
     
Back in December 2016, when I was eager to start my journey into Computer Science, one topic interested me in particular - Combinatorial Graphs. I had the good fortune of working with Prof. Rupesh Nasre of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras throughout the duration of the project.   

## The Idea

Just before I started working on this project, I had gone through <ahref = "https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/">this excellent blog post</a> on the implementation of a very basic shell in C. This motivated Prof. Nasre and myself to work on a shell for combinatorial graph applications. Some important points we had in mind were:

1) The interface had to be clean and clear, with no ambiguity for users. 
2) For the shell to actually be useful, it had to be capable of working on graphs that exist. The shell interface had to be able to read a file with information about nodes of the graph in a particular format, and work on that graph.
3) Finally, it had to be extensible.
